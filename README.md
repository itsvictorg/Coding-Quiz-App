Once the quiz has begun, a timer is started and user must answer the questions

If a selected choice is wrong, 5 seconds is deducted from the timer.

when the user wins/loses, they are displayed a screen with either losing text or winning text, their final score, and an input section to save their score.

A try again button is also rendered to begin the application again.
